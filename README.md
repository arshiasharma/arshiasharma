Hi! I'm a Senior Computer Science major with an Analytics minor at Chapman University with experience in data science and application software. I am currently a student tutor for various computer science and analytic classes and a liaison for Chapman's Fowler School of Engineering where I represent the engineering school in events with potential and current students. Some of my previous projects include creating applications for data storage, a business analytics interactive game used in classes, and a virtual DJ. I am very interested in looking into a career in data science to incorporate my major and minor and apply the skills I have learned from school and side projects to the workforce.
